The increased accumulation of both  stored triglycerides and VLDL particles inside the liver cells causes  a condition called fatty liver or hepatic steatosis. This can impair  normal liver function. The more alcohol consumed, the more lipids  produced and stored inside the liver cells. These effects are  cumulative over time.  According to the CDC, 14,406 Americans died from alcohol- related liver diseases in 2007. Although not every alcoholic or heavy  drinker will die from liver problems, the liver is one of the body’s  main filtering organs and is severely stressed by alcohol abuse.  The term Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) is used to describe liver  problems linked to excessive alcohol intake. ALD can be progressive,  with individuals first suffering from a fatty liver and going on to  develop cirrhosis. It is also possible to have different forms of ALD  at the same time.

These  foods also help to build the placenta and supply energy for the  growth of the unborn baby.  During pregnancy, extra protein is needed for the synthesis of  new maternal and fetal tissues. Protein builds muscle and other  tissues, enzymes, antibodies, and hormones in both the mother and  the unborn baby. Additional protein also supports increased blood  volume and the production of amniotic fluid. The RDA of protein  during pregnancy is 71 grams per day, which is 25 grams above the  normal recommendation. Protein should be derived from healthy  sources, such as lean red meat, poultry, legumes, nuts, seeds, eggs,  and fish. Low-fat milk and other dairy products also provide protein,  along with calcium and other nutrients.  There are no specific recommendations for fats in pregnancy,  apart from following normal dietary guidelines. Although this is  the case, it is recommended to increase the amount of essential  fatty acids linoleic acid and ∝-linolenic acid because they are  incorporated into the placenta and fetal tissues.\\xa0 Fats should make  up 25 to 35 percent of daily calories, and those calories should  come from healthy fats, such as avocados and salmon. It is not  recommended for pregnant women to be on a very low-fat diet,  since it would be hard to meet the needs of essential fatty acids and  fat-soluble vitamins. Fatty acids are important during pregnancy  because they support the baby’s brain and eye development.  Fluids  Fluid intake must also be monitored. According to the IOM,  pregnant women should drink 2.3 liters (about 10 cups) of liquids  per day to provide enough fluid for blood production. It is also  important to drink liquids during and after physical activity or when  it is hot and humid outside, to replace fluids lost to perspiration.  Pregnancy  |  793'},\n",

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

        "\n",
        "Recursive chunking is a strategy for splitting long text into smaller, manageable pieces while preserving the natural structure of the text as much as possible. Instead of splitting arbitrarily, it tries progressively larger-to-smaller breaks: sections, then paragraphs, then sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Check the block size**: If the block is already small enough (below `max_chunk_size`), keep it as is.\n",
        "2. **Split by big breaks first**: If it is too long, try splitting by double newlines (`\\n\\n`), which usually represent sections.\n",
        "3. **If still too long, split further**: If the section is still too big, split by single newlines (`\\n`), which usually represent paragraphs.\n",
        "4. **Fallback to sentences**: If the paragraph is still too large, split into individual sentences using a sentence tokenizer.\n",
        "5. **Repeat recursively**: Each new sub-chunk is checked again until all pieces are under the size limit.\n",
